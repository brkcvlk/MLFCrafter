## What is MLFCrafter?

MLFCrafter is a Python framework that simplifies machine learning pipeline creation through chainable "crafter" components. Build, train, and deploy ML models with minimal code and maximum flexibility.

### Key Features

- **üîó Chainable Architecture** - Connect multiple processing steps seamlessly
- **üìä Smart Data Handling** - Automatic data ingestion from CSV, Excel, JSON
- **üßπ Intelligent Cleaning** - Multiple strategies for missing value handling  
- **üìè Flexible Scaling** - MinMax, Standard, and Robust scaling options
- **ü§ñ Multiple Models** - Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression support
- **üìà Comprehensive Metrics** - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **üíæ Easy Deployment** - One-click model saving with metadata
- **üîÑ Context-Based** - Seamless data flow between pipeline steps


## Why MLFCrafter?

Writing the same ML boilerplate again and again is exhausting ‚Äî especially when juggling multiple datasets or experimenting with different models. MLFCrafter was created to solve exactly that.

Here‚Äôs why MLFCrafter might be the right tool for you:

‚úÖ **Automation without Black Box**: You automate repetitive steps, but still keep visibility and control over each stage.

‚úÖ **Modular by Design**: You can run only the steps you need. Don't want automatic data cleaning ? Just skip `CleanerCrafter` and plug in your own function.

‚úÖ **Readable & Reusable**: The API is simple, clean, and built for easy experimentation and reproducibility.

‚úÖ **Scikit-learn Compatible**: Use your favorite tools and estimators within the pipeline.

‚úÖ **Open for Extension**: You can build your own custom crafters if needed.

‚úÖ **Easy to Learn**: MLFCrafter‚Äôs intuitive API and clear component structure make it approachable even for users with basic machine learning knowledge. You don‚Äôt need to dive deep into complex frameworks to start building.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install mlfcrafter
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from mlfcrafter import MLFChain, DataIngestCrafter, CleanerCrafter, ScalerCrafter, ModelCrafter, ScorerCrafter, DeployCrafter

# Create ML pipeline in one line
chain = MLFChain(
    DataIngestCrafter(data_path="data/iris.csv"),
    CleanerCrafter(strategy="auto"),
    ScalerCrafter(scaler_type="standard"),
    ModelCrafter(model_name="random_forest"),
    ScorerCrafter(),
    DeployCrafter()
)

# Run entire pipeline
results = chain.run(target_column="species")
print(f"Test Score: {results['test_score']:.4f}")
```

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
